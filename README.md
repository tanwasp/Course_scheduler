# Course_scheduler
Software that helps students create schedules from a list of courses. 

Initial Version
Uses a while loop to input as many courses with the titles, priority rating and timing and outputs an optimised four or specified number of courses list as the final list of courses to take for a semester

Extended Version
1. Front end could be made better
2. Could output different possibilities of courses for the user to look at
3. Could take in the number of requests for each class and using other data like number of majors, number of students, etc, have a range of probabilities to get a certain class, or class schedule. 
4. If good enough, could be submitted to Vassar and make use of JSON and web APIs or something to get the data directly from the Vassar ask banner website to make picking courses easier. Courses could then be selected based on departments or by entering part of the title from a drop down search menu or something.
